# Turtle 1.18 Server Features

Custom server-side patches for the
[r-o-sh/tortoise-wow](https://github.com/r-o-sh/tortoise-wow) mangos core
(`playerbots-integration-gh` branch), built for a private Turtle WoW 1.12
server running against a 1.18 client.

Each patch is self-contained — pick the ones you want, in any combination.
There are no "fix the previous patch" follow-ups; every patch reflects its
final state.

**Base commit:** generated against
[`5e5e40c`](https://github.com/r-o-sh/tortoise-wow/commit/5e5e40c) on the
`playerbots-integration-gh` branch.

## Features

| Patch | What it does | Extra steps |
|---|---|---|
| [`0001`](patches/0001-Add-world-buffs-automatic-donation-points-and-fix-th.patch) **World buffs, donation points, shop fix** | Periodic world buffs, restricted by zone and faction: Spirit of Zandalar (Stranglethorn Vale), Warchief's Blessing (Horde, Crossroads/Orgrimmar), Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer (Alliance in Stormwind, Horde in Orgrimmar). Each buff runs on its own timer so they don't all fire at once, with a shorter first interval after a restart. Plus `AutoDonationPoints`: real players (bots and the Discord bridge excluded) earn shop currency per hour online, persisted across restarts. Also fixes the Donation Rewards window showing only the "About" tab — the client expects a `parentId` field the server never sent, which threw a Lua error that aborted category parsing on the first entry. | config + SQL |
| [`0002`](patches/0002-Auto-join-new-low-level-players-into-the-configured-.patch) **Beginners guild** | Auto-joins new, guildless real players (level ≤ 5) into a configured welcome guild on first login. | config |
| [`0003`](patches/0003-Fix-playerbot-battlegrounds-queueing-combat-and-flag.patch) **Playerbot battlegrounds** | Fixes playerbots silently failing to queue for battlegrounds at all (their join packet was never processed); three separate reasons they never fought (attack trigger only wired into a combat engine idle bots never entered, target list only ever saw units already attacking them, flag-carrier attack check tested the wrong unit's aura); and flag carriers freezing forever mid-map. Bots no longer fetch the enemy flag on their own initiative — unless their own team has no real players, so solo-vs-bots matches aren't a walkover. Adds a 20-minute hard match cutoff. | – |
| [`0004`](patches/0004-Fix-WSG-and-AB-graveyard-resurrection-using-stale-va.patch) **BG graveyard resurrection** ⚠️ | Fixes "Release Spirit" leaving you stuck at your corpse in WSG/AB instead of teleporting to a graveyard. **Environment-specific — read below before applying.** | – |

### ⚠️ About patch 0004

Both battlegrounds hardcode the standard vanilla `WorldSafeLocs.dbc`
graveyard IDs. On this server's DBC (extracted from a Turtle WoW 1.18
client, 174 entries total) those IDs simply don't exist, so every lookup
returned NULL. The same graveyard locations *do* exist, just under
different IDs, and this patch swaps in the ones that matched.

**Those replacement IDs are only correct for a DBC missing the standard
entries in exactly this way.** If graveyard resurrection already works on
your server, do not apply this patch — it will send players to unrelated
locations. To check your own DBC:

```bash
python3 - <<'EOF'
import struct
with open('data/dbc/WorldSafeLocs.dbc','rb') as f:
    f.read(4)
    count, fields, size, _ = struct.unpack('<IIII', f.read(16))
    ids = {struct.unpack('<I', f.read(size)[:4])[0] for _ in range(count)}
print('total entries:', count)
print('has vanilla WSG ids (769-772):', {769,770,771,772} <= ids)
print('has vanilla AB ids (889,890,893-899):', {889,890,893,894,895,896,897,898,899} <= ids)
EOF
```

If both report `True`, skip this patch.

## Applying

```bash
cd /path/to/tortoise-playerbots
git am /path/to/0001-Add-world-buffs-automatic-donation-points-and-fix-th.patch
# ... repeat for whichever others you want, in ascending order
```

Then, if you applied a patch that needs them:

1. **SQL** — apply [`sql/donation_point_progress.sql`](sql/donation_point_progress.sql)
   to your **login** database (patch 0001 only).
2. **Config** — append the relevant blocks from
   [`conf/mangosd.conf.additions`](conf/mangosd.conf.additions) to your
   `mangosd.conf`. Note the `*.Enable` switches default to **off**.
3. **Rebuild and restart** — these are C++ source changes:
   ```bash
   cd build && make -j$(nproc) mangosd
   ```

If `git am` fails to apply cleanly (likely if your tree has diverged from
the base commit), fall back to:

```bash
git apply --reject /path/to/the.patch   # applies what it can, leaves .rej files
```

and resolve the rejected hunks by hand.
